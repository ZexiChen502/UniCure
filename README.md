# UniCure: A Foundation Model for Predicting Personalized Cancer Therapy Response ðŸ’Š

## Overview ðŸŒŸ
UniCure is the **first multimodal foundation model** integrating omics (UCE) and chemical (Uni-mol) foundation models to predict transcriptomic drug responses across diverse cellular contexts. Trained on **1.8M+ perturbation profiles** (22k compounds, 166 cell types, 24 tissues), it enables:  

ðŸ’¡ **Key Innovations**  
- **FlexPert**: Sliding-window cross-attention for flexible drug-cell interaction modeling  
- **LoRA-PEFT**: Parameter-efficient tuning preserving pretrained knowledge  
- **MMD loss**: Handles unpaired perturbation data without cell matching
